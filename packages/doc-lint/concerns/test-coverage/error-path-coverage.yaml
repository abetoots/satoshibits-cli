# =============================================================================
# CONCERN: Error Path Test Coverage
# =============================================================================
# This concern validates that every error path and failure mode documented in
# the ADD or FRD has a corresponding test specification. Error paths include
# timeout handling, retry exhaustion, circuit breaker trips, validation
# failures, authentication failures, dependency outages, and data corruption
# scenarios. These are the paths most likely to cause production incidents
# yet least likely to be tested.
#
# WHY THIS MATTERS:
# Happy paths get tested naturally because developers exercise them during
# development. Error paths are invisible until production traffic triggers
# them. When a payment gateway times out, when a circuit breaker opens, when
# a retry budget is exhausted - the system follows code paths that were never
# verified. The result: cascading failures, data corruption, silent data loss,
# or user-facing errors that expose internal system details. Error paths in
# distributed systems are especially dangerous because they involve partial
# failures, network partitions, and race conditions that are difficult to
# reason about without explicit testing.
#
# TYPICAL MANIFESTATION:
# - ADD documents "circuit breaker opens after 5 failures" but no test
#   verifies the fallback behavior when the circuit is open
# - FRD specifies "show friendly error message on payment timeout" but no
#   test simulates a payment timeout to verify the message
# - ADD describes retry policy with exponential backoff but no test verifies
#   behavior after all retries are exhausted
# - Validation rules documented in FRD but only happy-path inputs tested

    Validates that every documented error path, failure mode, and degraded

    paths are the code paths exercised when things go wrong: timeouts, retry
    exhaustion, circuit breaker activation, validation failures, auth failures,
    dependency outages, and data integrity violations. These paths are
    disproportionately responsible for production incidents because they are
    exercised rarely during development but frequently under production load.

# EVALUATION: The reasoning task
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
evaluation:
  question: |
    Systematically extract every documented error path and failure mode from
    the ADD and FRD, then verify that each one has a corresponding test
    specification that exercises the error condition and verifies the expected
    system behavior.

    STEP 1: EXTRACT DOCUMENTED ERROR PATHS FROM ADD AND FRD
    Scan all architecture and functional documents for explicitly described
    failure scenarios, error handling behavior, and degraded modes:

    a) TIMEOUT HANDLING
       - API call timeouts (connection timeout, read timeout, total timeout)
       - Database query timeouts
       - Message queue consumption timeouts
       - User session timeouts
       - Async operation timeouts (job execution, workflow step timeouts)
       - Look for: timeout, deadline, max-wait, TTL, expires

    b) RETRY EXHAUSTION
       - What happens after all retry attempts fail
       - Dead letter queue behavior when messages cannot be processed
       - Final fallback after retry budget is consumed
       - User notification when retries are exhausted
       - Look for: retry exhausted, max retries, final failure, dead letter,
         give up, no more retries, retry budget

    c) CIRCUIT BREAKER ACTIVATION
       - Behavior when circuit breaker opens (fail-fast, cached response,
         degraded mode, queue for later)
       - Half-open state behavior (probe requests)
       - Circuit breaker recovery and close behavior
       - Cascading circuit breaker effects across services
       - Look for: circuit breaker, circuit open, fail-fast, fallback,
         half-open, degraded mode, bulkhead

    d) VALIDATION FAILURES
       - Input validation errors (malformed data, missing fields, type errors)
       - Business rule violations (insufficient funds, exceeded quota)
       - Schema validation failures (API request/response mismatch)
       - Data integrity violations (duplicate keys, referential integrity)
       - Look for: validation, invalid, malformed, schema error, constraint
         violation, duplicate, integrity

    e) AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION FAILURES
       - Invalid credentials handling
       - Expired token behavior
       - Insufficient permissions response
       - Session hijacking or token theft detection
       - OAuth/OIDC error flows (authorization denied, token refresh failure)
       - Look for: unauthorized, forbidden, 401, 403, token expired, auth
         failure, permission denied, access denied

    f) DEPENDENCY FAILURES
       - External service unavailability (third-party API down)
       - Database connection pool exhaustion
       - Message broker unavailability
       - DNS resolution failures
       - TLS certificate expiration or mismatch
       - Look for: unavailable, connection refused, connection pool, service
         down, dependency failure, 503, 502

    g) DATA CORRUPTION AND CONSISTENCY FAILURES
       - Handling of corrupted or unexpected data formats
       - Stale cache behavior and cache invalidation failures
       - Eventual consistency window behavior
       - Conflict resolution for concurrent writes
       - Look for: corrupt, stale, inconsistent, conflict, race condition,
         concurrent, out of sync

    For each error path, record:
    - A descriptive identifier for the error path
    - The source document and section where it is described
    - The error type category (from the list above)
    - The documented expected behavior when this error occurs

    STEP 2: CHECK FOR CORRESPONDING TEST SPECIFICATIONS
    For each documented error path identified in Step 1, search across all
    test documentation for test coverage:

    a) DIRECT ERROR PATH TESTS
       - Test cases that explicitly simulate the error condition
       - Test descriptions that mention the specific failure mode
       - Chaos engineering or fault injection test plans
       - Look for: test case, negative test, error test, failure test,
         fault injection, chaos test

    b) TEST APPROACH ASSESSMENT
       For each error path, determine what test approach is used:
       - Mock/stub-based: external dependency is mocked to return errors
       - Fault injection: actual infrastructure faults are simulated
       - Integration test: real dependencies in controlled failure state
       - Manual test procedure: exploratory testing script
       - No test: error path has no test specification

    c) COVERAGE COMPLETENESS
       For each error path test, verify it covers:
       - The trigger condition (what causes the error)
       - The system's immediate response (error handling logic)
       - The user-facing behavior (error message, degraded UI, retry prompt)
       - The system's recovery behavior (how it returns to normal)
       - Side effects (logging, alerting, metrics, audit trail)

    STEP 3: FLAG ERROR PATHS WITHOUT TEST COVERAGE
    Identify all gaps and assess their severity based on blast radius:

    a) CRITICAL GAPS (payment, auth, data integrity error paths)
       - Payment timeout without test: risk of double charges or lost payments
       - Auth failure without test: risk of security bypass or information leak
       - Data corruption without test: risk of silent data loss
       - These error paths affect user trust, financial accuracy, or security

    b) SIGNIFICANT GAPS (resilience and dependency error paths)
       - Circuit breaker without test: fallback behavior unverified
       - Retry exhaustion without test: final failure behavior unknown
       - Dependency outage without test: cascading failure risk unverified

    c) MODERATE GAPS (validation and user experience error paths)
       - Validation failure without test: error messages may be unhelpful
       - Session timeout without test: user experience during timeout unknown
       - These affect user experience but not system integrity

  failure_condition: |
    Report as ERROR when:

    1. A payment or financial error path has no test coverage
       (error_type is "timeout", "retry-exhaustion", or "dependency-failure"
       AND the error path involves payment processing, billing, or financial
       transactions). Untested payment error paths risk double charges,
       lost payments, or financial data inconsistency.

    2. An authentication or authorization error path has no test coverage
       (error_type is "auth-failure"). Untested auth error paths risk
       security bypasses, session fixation, or information disclosure.

    3. A documented circuit breaker fallback behavior has no test verifying
       what the user experiences when the circuit is open. The fallback
       is the most critical path - it runs when the system is already
       degraded.

    4. A data corruption or consistency error path has no test coverage
       (error_type is "data-corruption"). Untested corruption handling
       risks silent data loss or propagation of corrupt data.

    5. More than 60% of documented error paths have no test specifications
       (systemic lack of error path testing).

    Report as WARNING when:

    1. Any documented error path lacks a corresponding test specification
       (test_exists is FALSE) regardless of error type.

    2. A test exists but uses a simplistic approach that may not accurately
       simulate the real failure mode (e.g., returning an error code vs.
       simulating actual network timeout with delay).

    3. A test covers the error trigger but does not verify recovery behavior
       (test confirms error is caught but not that system recovers to normal
       operation afterward).

    4. An error path is tested at the unit level only but involves
       cross-service behavior that requires integration testing.

    5. Error paths are documented in the ADD but the test plan has no
       dedicated section for negative/error testing (suggests error testing
       was not systematically planned).

  recommendation_template: |
    ## Gap: Untested Error Path - {error_path}

    **Error Type:** {error_type}
    **Source:** {error_source}
    **Test Exists:** {test_exists}

    ### Missing Error Path Test

    This error path is documented in the architecture or functional
    specification but has no corresponding test specification. When this
    failure mode occurs in production, the system's behavior will be
    unverified and may not match documented expectations.

    ### Recommended Actions

    1. **Create Error Path Test**:
       Add a test case that explicitly simulates this failure condition
       and verifies the documented handling behavior.

    2. **Define Test Approach**:
       - For timeouts: use configurable delays or mock delayed responses
       - For dependency failures: mock dependency to return error/unavailable
       - For circuit breaker: trigger enough failures to open the circuit,
         then verify fallback behavior
       - For auth failures: use invalid/expired credentials and verify
         appropriate error responses without information leakage

    3. **Verify Complete Error Handling**:
       The test should verify:
       - Error is detected correctly (trigger condition)
       - System responds appropriately (error handling logic)
       - User sees correct feedback (error message, degraded UI)
       - System recovers properly (return to normal after error clears)
       - Observability works (logs, metrics, alerts are emitted)

    4. **Consider Chaos Engineering**:
       For critical error paths in distributed systems, consider fault
       injection testing that simulates real infrastructure failures
       rather than mocked responses.
