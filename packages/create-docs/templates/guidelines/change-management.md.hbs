# Change Management Guidelines

**Project:** {{projectName}}

## 1. Overview

This document defines the process for managing changes to {{projectName}}, including code changes, configuration updates, and infrastructure modifications.

## 2. Change Categories

| Category | Risk | Approval | Examples |
|----------|------|----------|----------|
| Standard | Low | Auto-approve | Bug fixes, minor UI changes |
| Normal | Medium | Tech Lead | New features, API changes |
| Emergency | High | On-call + Lead | Security patches, outages |
{{#if variance.isRegulated}}
| Regulated | Critical | CAB | Compliance-impacting changes |
{{/if}}

## 3. Git Workflow

### 3.1 Branch Strategy (Trunk-Based)

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "main"
    branch feature/user-auth
    commit id: "feat"
    commit id: "test"
    checkout main
    merge feature/user-auth
    commit id: "release"
```

### 3.2 Branch Naming

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Feature | `feature/<ticket>-<description>` | `feature/PROJ-123-user-auth` |
| Bugfix | `fix/<ticket>-<description>` | `fix/PROJ-456-login-error` |
| Hotfix | `hotfix/<description>` | `hotfix/security-patch` |

### 3.3 Commit Messages

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Maintenance

## 4. Code Review Process

### 4.1 Requirements

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No new linting errors
- [ ] Code coverage maintained
- [ ] At least 1 approval required
- [ ] No unresolved comments

### 4.2 Review Checklist

**Reviewer should verify:**

- [ ] Code matches requirements
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Error handling is appropriate
- [ ] Tests cover new functionality
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed

### 4.3 Review Timeline

| Change Type | Expected Review Time |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Small (<100 lines) | Same day |
| Medium (100-500 lines) | 1-2 days |
| Large (>500 lines) | 2-3 days |

## 5. Deployment Process

### 5.1 Environments

| Environment | Purpose | Deployment |
|-------------|---------|------------|
| Development | Feature testing | On push |
| Staging | Integration testing | On PR merge |
| Production | Live system | Manual trigger |

### 5.2 Deployment Checklist

- [ ] All CI checks pass
- [ ] Staging verification complete
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards ready
- [ ] On-call notified (for major changes)

### 5.3 Rollback Procedure

```bash
# identify last known good deployment
git log --oneline -10

# revert to previous release
git revert <commit-hash>

# or roll back infrastructure
./scripts/rollback.sh <version>
```

## 6. Risk Assessment

### 6.1 Impact Matrix

| Factor | Low | Medium | High |
|--------|-----|--------|------|
| Users affected | <100 | 100-1000 | >1000 |
| Data changes | None | Read paths | Write paths |
| Downtime | None | <5 min | >5 min |

### 6.2 Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Data loss | Backup before migration |
| Performance | Load test in staging |
| Breaking changes | Feature flags |
| Dependency issues | Lock file verification |

## 7. Compliance Requirements

### 7.1 Change Advisory Board (CAB)

For regulated changes:

1. Submit change request form
2. CAB review (weekly meeting)
3. Approval/rejection documented
4. Implementation window assigned
5. Post-implementation review

### 7.2 Audit Trail

All changes must include:

- Change request ID
- Approver name and timestamp
- Implementation evidence
- Rollback verification

### 7.3 Documentation Requirements

| Document | Required For |
|----------|-------------|
| Change Request | All regulated changes |
| Risk Assessment | Medium+ risk changes |
| Test Evidence | All production changes |
| Rollback Plan | All production changes |
{{/if}}

## 8. Emergency Changes

### 8.1 Criteria

Emergency changes are only for:
- Security vulnerabilities (active exploit)
- Complete service outage
- Data integrity issues
